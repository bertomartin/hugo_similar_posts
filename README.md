# Hugo Similar Posts

Computing similar posts for my [blog](https://elbauldelprogramador.com/en/) using Sklearn Kmeans

# Usage

Modify the path where your posts are in [Line 470](https://github.com/elbaulp/hugo_similar_posts/blob/master/similar_posts.py#L470) and then execute.

```
$ python ./similar_posts.py
```

# TODO

At some point I should make the path an arg to pass to the program using `argparse`, but since Hugo now has a _similar posts_ feature I am using that instead of my project.
